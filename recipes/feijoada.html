    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the black beans in water overnight, then drain them before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook
        until crispy, then remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pork shoulder and sausage to the pot and cook until browned on
        all sides. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pot, saut√© the onion and garlic until softened, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the soaked black beans, bay leaves, cumin, paprika, salt, and pepper
        to the pot. Stir to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the cooked bacon, pork shoulder, and sausage to the pot. Add the
        water or chicken broth and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours, or until the beans are
        tender and the meat is cooked through, adding more water if necessary to
        maintain the desired consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the Feijoada with rice, collard greens, and orange slices. Garnish
        with fresh cilantro.
