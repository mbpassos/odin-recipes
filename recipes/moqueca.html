    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 kg firm white fish fillets (such as tilapia or snapper)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lime juice</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>400ml coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon palm oil (optional)</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the fish fillets with lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper for
        at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat the olive oil (and palm oil, if using) over medium
        heat. Add the onion and bell pepper, and saut√© until softened, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot and cook for another 2 minutes,
        stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the coconut milk and bring the mixture to a simmer. Stir in the
        paprika and some additional salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently place the marinated fish fillets into the pot. Cover and cook for
        10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through and flakes easily
        with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle fresh cilantro over the top of the Moqueca and serve
        immediately with rice.
      </li>
    </ol>
